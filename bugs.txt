TODO:

Release blockers.

- Not ticking over to new day when app is still open overnight. (Testing tonight)
   - Can reproduce. Need to make this work when app is open somehow.

- Move popup a few pixels down like memory clean has.

- Not deleting/clearing previous days tasks.

- menubar attach/detach feature like memory clean has

- Write app description / sales pitch.

- TESTING (write actual swift unit tests for fun?)

- Testing for fresh installs (empty data)

- Fix dark mode app styles.

- ensure the storage area in application support folder doesn't have weird name like danlennox.twodo

- General code cleanup.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Potential future features
- UI button to reset record?
- Bar graphic - 1 segment = 1 day
- I should almost definitely be using an NSTable with NSTableCells for the layout of the
two list items....
- Proper MVC pattern usage refactor.

- OO Refactor - turn list items and streak recorder into new classes that extend 
  NSManagedObject
