TODO:

- OO Refactor - turn list items and streak recorder into new classes that extend 
  NSManagedObject

- Implement messenger status box
- Write app description / sales pitch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Potential future features
- UI button to reset record?
- Bar graphic - 1 segment = 1 day
- I should almost definitely be using an NSTable with NSTableCells for the layout of the
two list items....
- Proper MVC pattern usage refactor.
