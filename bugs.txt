TODO:


- Remove flash from tick
- Hand hover on tick

- Clicking both items increments the current and longest streak on the spot, not next day

- Unclicking one of the items (after above) then will decrease the current and longest streak on the spot.
- Visual feedback for - new record, finishing your daily tasks
- Bar graphic - 1 segment = 1 day
- Write app description / sales pitch.
- TESTING (write actual swift unit tests for fun?)
- Submit to app store.

BUGS:

- reopen the app, anything that was checked already doesn't have grey text anymore.
- The clicking issue with the icon
- Got to record of 3 days... then I'm not sure but it might not have reset the current streak
after the end of day 4.
