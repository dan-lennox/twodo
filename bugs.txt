TODO:

Release blockers.

- Not ticking over to new day when app is still open overnight. (Testing tonight)

- Move popup a few pixels down like memory clean has.

- Slightly difficult to reproduce app where the status item stays highlighted when
the popover is hidden.

- menubar attach/detach feature like memory clean has

- Write app description / sales pitch.
- TESTING (write actual swift unit tests for fun?)

Testing for fresh installs (empty data)

Create icon

- ensure the storage area in application support folder doesn't have weird name like danlennox.twodo

- Submit to app store.

- Implement messenger status box
  - New record!
  - +5 - do you really want to go back to 0?
  - 









----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Potential future features
- UI button to reset record?
- Bar graphic - 1 segment = 1 day
- I should almost definitely be using an NSTable with NSTableCells for the layout of the
two list items....
- Proper MVC pattern usage refactor.

- OO Refactor - turn list items and streak recorder into new classes that extend 
  NSManagedObject
