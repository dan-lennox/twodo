TODO:

Release blockers.

- Support for two lines.

- Intermittent bug: Halfway through writing the second item, the second and first item
disappear. Reproduce and fix.

- Finalise messages

- Write app description / sales pitch.

Twodobot is a different kind of todo list. Twodobot doesn't care about
all the things you need to do, just the two most important ones. Get those
right and your todo streak will increase. You might even receive a kind word.
But remember, Twodobot also doesn't care for excuses, so slip up once and he'll
knock you straight back down to zero and he probably won't be all that
nice about it! Twodobot also doesn't stand for Todo stagnation. Each day your tasks
are wiped so you'll need consider which two tasks are ACTUALLY important.

Twodobot is a simple, gamified Todolist that tries make getting your top two tasks
done everyday as strong a habit as brushing your teeth (for those of you who do in-fact
brush your teeth daily).


- TESTING (write actual swift unit tests for fun?)

- Testing for fresh installs (empty data)
   
- Submit to app store.


  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Move popup a few pixels down like memory clean has.
Potential future features
- menubar attach/detach feature like memory clean has
- Bar graphic - 1 segment = 1 day
- I should almost definitely be using an NSTable with NSTableCells for the layout of the
two list items....
- Proper MVC pattern usage refactor.

- OO Refactor - turn list items and streak recorder into new classes that extend 
  NSManagedObject
