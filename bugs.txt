TODO:


- Remove flash from tick
- Hand hover on tick
- Vertically center list item text
- List item green background and strikethrough on tick. 


- OO Refactor - turn list items and streak recorder into new classes that extend 
  NSManagedObject
- Visual feedback for - new record, finishing your daily tasks

- I should almost definitely be using an NSTable with NSTableCells for the layout of the
two list items....

- Implement messenger status box
- Write app description / sales pitch.
- TESTING (write actual swift unit tests for fun?)

Testing for fresh installs (empty data)

- Submit to app store.


Potential future features
- UI button to reset record?
- Bar graphic - 1 segment = 1 day


BUGS:

- reopen the app, anything that was checked already doesn't have grey text anymore.
- The clicking issue with the icon
- Got to record of 3 days... then I'm not sure but it might not have reset the current streak
after the end of day 4.








Need to ensure that the current streak holds when I reopen the app.
