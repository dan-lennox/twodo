----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Move popup a few pixels down like memory clean has.
Potential future features
- menubar attach/detach feature like memory clean has
- Bar graphic - 1 segment = 1 day
- I should almost definitely be using an NSTable with NSTableCells for the layout of the
two list items....
- Proper MVC pattern usage refactor.

  NSManagedObject
